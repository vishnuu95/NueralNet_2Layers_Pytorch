KEY TAKE AWAYS\n","\n","\n","* There was no real linear trend found.\n","*   It is good to overfit our model first and then fit it correctly.\n","*   Tuning the hyperparameters is far from intuitive. Accuracies and loss trends are linear only in small neighborhood.\n","*   Accuracy and Loss for training / testing need not go hand in hand. Once, it was noticed that training higher, but training accuracy was better.\n","*   Using Momentum helped converge rapidly.\n","*   Reducing batch size also helped converge quickly.\n","*   Early stopping in cases when Loss was stagnant didn't seem to help much. \n","*   Having some momentum did help converge faster but it also overfit the model.\n","*   The same accuracy can be achieved with a diverse set of hyperparameters.\n","* L2 regularization was key to avoid overfitting. \n","\n","\n","\n","## 2.  THINGS TO EXPLORE / UNANSWERED QUESTIONS\n","\n","* Not sure why augmentation of data didn't help much(horizontal flip).\n","* Would  (lr + zero momentum for high epochs) be better than (lr + high momentum for lower epochs) to avoid overfitting. \n","* Not sure why shuffling of data reduced testing accuracy (it did reduce testing loss though).\n","\n","## 3.

The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High.
